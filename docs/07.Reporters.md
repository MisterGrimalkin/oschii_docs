# Reporters

A Reporter converts Oschii messages into OSC or HTTP and sends them to a specified IP address on the
network.

Reporters are defined by JSON objects in a top-level array called `"Reporters"`.

Reporters do not support Conditions, Message Builders, Value Transforms, or Subs, and they cannot
send messages to other components.

By default, a Reporter will use OSC. To use HTTP instead, set `httpMethod` to a valid value.

A single Reporter cannot use both protocols, but we can create multiple Reporters on the same IP address
with different protocol and ports.

With HTTP POST and PUT requests, the content of the message is contained in the payload as a JSON
array. With GET requests, the JSON array is contained in a query parameter called `message`.

The message held by an OSC Reporter will be the last message it sent out. An HTTP Reporter will store the
response status code of its last HTTP request.

When sending messages to a Reporter, we specify the OSC/HTTP address within the Component Reference.

### JSON Definition

| Property     | Description          | Value                | Default               |
|--------------|----------------------|----------------------|-----------------------|
| `ip`         | Target IP Address    | string               | *REQUIRED*            |
| `oscPort`    | Target port for OSC  | integer              | 3333                  |
| `httpPort`   | Target port for HTTP | integer              | 80                    |
| `httpMethod` | HTTP Method          | "post", "put", "get" | (if not set, use OSC) |

### Examples

This example defines one OSC Reporter and one Analog Sensor. Whenever the Sensor changes, the new value is sent
as an OSC message to the address `/knob_was_twiddled` on the host at 192.168.1.201, port 3333.

```json
{
  "Reporters": [
    {
      "name": "Ada",
      "ip": "192.168.1.201"
    }
  ],
  "Sensors": [
    {
      "name": "Knob",
      "type": "analog",
      "pin": 36,
      "target": "Reporter:Ada/knob_was_twiddled"
    }
  ]
}
```

Now we add a second Reporter, this one using HTTP. The Sensor's new value is now sent as OSC to 192.168.1.201,
port 3333, AND as an HTTP POST request to 192.168.1.202, port 80.

```json
{
  "Reporters": [
    {
      "name": "Ada",
      "ip": "192.168.1.201"
    },
    {
      "name": "Bob",
      "ip": "192.168.1.202",
      "httpMethod": "post"
    }
  ],
  "Sensors": [
    {
      "name": "Knob",
      "type": "analog",
      "pin": 36,
      "target": "Reporter:*/knob_was_twiddled"
    }
  ]
}
```

We can simplify the Sensor's `target` property by using the "All Reporters" shortcut. The next example is exactly
equivalent to the last.

```json
{
  "Reporters": [
    {
      "name": "Ada",
      "ip": "192.168.1.201"
    },
    {
      "name": "Bob",
      "ip": "192.168.1.202",
      "httpMethod": "post"
    }
  ],
  "Sensors": [
    {
      "name": "Knob",
      "type": "analog",
      "pin": 36,
      "*": "knob_was_twiddled"
    }
  ]
}
```
